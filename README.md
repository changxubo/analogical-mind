# Analogical Mind Skill

## What we built:

A cross-domain problem-solving skill that surfaces fresh perspectives from 12+ domains
Clean 3-step process: Abstract the problem → Surface analogies → Apply concretely
Rich reference catalog with 80+ patterns ready to deploy

## How to install:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/changxubo/analogical-mind --skill analogical-mind
```
## Sample usage:

Just say things like "How do I make my team more coordinated?" or "How should I think about this decision?" and the skill will draw analogies from ant colonies, jazz ensembles, poker strategy, Roman roads, and more.

Would you like to iterate on anything, or try it with a different problem?
