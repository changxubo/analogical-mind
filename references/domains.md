## How to Use This Catalog

1. **Don't read it all** — Scan for domains relevant to the abstracted problem
2. **Mix distant and near** — Biology for fresh perspectives, sports for relatable ones
3. **Add your own** — If you think of a concept not listed, use it
4. **Match the pattern** — Not every concept fits every problem; be selective
5. **Go deep when needed** — If one analogy resonates, explore that domain further
